Help:

randChar() generates a random character. Takes no arguments.
randomArrIndex() generates a random number within the range of 0 and the size of the array/vector. Takes in an index (which is the size) argument.
randNum() generates a random number. Takes 2 arguments, the first range and the last range.

How I got the idea to make this:

I come from Python, and 90% of the projects I used to make had the library called "random" imported, I came to C++ and realised all of these are gone.

I learnt more about C++ and how I could turn an int to a char.

One day I thought about that, I could actually make my own "random" library like I wanted. And figured it out, here it is.
